# assh â€” It's SSH, but ASSh

`assh` is an implementation of SSH...  
but it's **less secure** and **blazingly slow**.

Named it "assh" so I can say:  
> _"It's SSH but ASSh"_ 

But hey, I'm proud of it.

Just a final year student messing around with cryptography and sockets, trying to understand how SSH works from scratch.

## What it does (so far)

- Does a janky but working **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**
- Uses **AES-CTR** for symmetric encryption
- Uses **SHA256** for hashing stuff
- Sends and receives commands over a TCP socket (with encryption)
- Uses big integers via **LibTomMath**

Basically, you can run a server and client and send encrypted messages

## How to build

Clone the repo, `cd` into it, then:

```bash
make
```

## Stuff I didnâ€™t write

### AES (Brian Gladman)
Iâ€™m using [Brian Gladmanâ€™s AES implementation](https://github.com/BrianGladman/aes) in CTR mode
You can find it in `crypto/aes/`

### SHA256 (Zedwood)
For SHA256, I used [zedwood's single-file SHA256 implementation](http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-sha256-function).  
You can find it at `crypto/hashing/sha256.cpp`

### Big Ints (LibTomMath)
Used [LibTomMath](https://github.com/libtom/libtommath) for doing big int math
Itâ€™s public domain and handles all the modular exponentiation stuff in DH

## Why I did thisðŸ™ƒ

Wanted to learn how SSH kinda works under the hood
Also wanted to touch some actual crypto code instead of just using OpenSSL as a black box.
